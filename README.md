Project Overview:
Title: Automated Web Form Submission System
Tools & Technologies: Selenium WebDriver with Java, TestNG, Maven
Project Description:
Objective:
To automate the submission process of a complex web form that captures user details, preferences, and attachments. The goal was to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and reduce manual intervention.

Key Features of the Web Form:

Input Fields:
  Name
  Phone Number
  Email Address
  "Tell us a bit about yourself" text area

  Validating user inputs against expected formats and values.
  Uploading and verifying the correctness of attached documents.
  Ensuring all mandatory fields are populated before submission.
  
Solution Approach:

Framework Setup:
  Established a Selenium Java-based framework using TestNG for test case management and Maven for dependency     management.
  
Element Identification:
  Used XPath and CSS selectors to locate and interact with web elements, ensuring robustness against UI changes.

Test Scenarios:
  Developed comprehensive test scenarios covering positive and negative test cases to validate all form functionalities.
  
Data-Driven Testing:
  Implemented data-driven testing to validate various combinations of inputs, age selections, and document uploads.
  
Reporting & Logging:
  Integrated reporting mechanisms to capture test results and logging to track test execution details.

Outcome:
  Successfully automated the end-to-end submission process of the web form.
  Achieved a significant reduction in manual effort and time consumption.
  Enhanced the reliability and repeatability of the form submission process.
  
Key Learnings:
